You should be aware that there are certain things that Hana Sherbachuk will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hana Sherbachuk cannot take responsibility for the apps not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using our apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the apps, or other third party charges. In using our apps, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
